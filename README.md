computational experiments investigating [socially adaptive belief](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mila.12294).

experiment 1:
positive illusion bias in multiagent rl. details forthcoming.

there are hard semantic questions around "belief formation" in artificial agents; early experiments will not address this, instead settling for a study of outward deception.

experiment log info will be moved to a more suitable location than this at some point.
